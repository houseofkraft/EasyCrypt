I have compiled this program using Launch4J, however it is not digtally signed. Your anti-virus software might go after this file however that is a "false-positive".
If you think there is a virus in this software, the source code is a few directories back and you can see for yourself exactly what this does.

Also, if you don't know how to exactly use this, I uploaded a YouTube video explaining a live demo (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb2R6Y88Li4)
